# CANDIDATE CODING ASSIGNMENT

## Application
Dear Calastone,

This is my application which i believe solves the issue described.  Within the src folder you will find my application seperated into 3 layers
ContentFilerApp.Console
		|
		V
ContentFilerApp.Core
		|
		V
ContentFilerApp.Infrastructure

To run please run from ContentFilerApp.Console.

## Unit Tests
Next to the src folder will be a tests folder.  This will hold Unit tests for the application.
They all should pass.

Kind regards

Michael
